## Description
This was a project for my Level Design I class (CPSC-244) at Chapman University. The goal was to create a simple 3D game based on the example Roll-a-Ball game from Unity's tutorials. We were to add three new features of our choosing to the game. I chose to add slopes, falling of platforms, and music. The music, UI, and models were created by myself.

Level Design Approach:
</h3>
All three levels were designed using the concept of IPM (Introduce, Practice, Master), which is a method of teaching that introduces a concept, allows the player to practice the concept, and then allows the player to master the concept. The levels were designed to be simple and easy to complete, but still challenging enough to be fun.

#### Level 1:
- Introduces the player to the concept of moving the ball and collecting gems within a time limit.

#### Level 2:
- Introduces the concept of navigating slopes in the game.
- The player practices moving the ball and collecting gems within a time limit.

#### Level 3:
- Introduces the concept of avoiding falling off platforms.
- Practices moving the ball on slopes.
- The player masters moving the ball and collecting gems within a time limit.

## Installation
1. Go to the [Releases] page and download the latest release.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Run `Boll-a-Rall.exe` to start the game.

## Usage
1. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the ball.
2. Collect all the gems before the timer runs out.
3. Avoid falling off the platforms.
4. Complete all three levels to win the game.
